ArduHPR
=======

Arduino based telemetry and deployment control based on arudpilot for High Power Rockets. 

HPR is quite different from the typical adrupilot (autopilot) system in that rockets have no autopilot, no RC, and no missions. So, while chunks of this code were lifted from the ArduCopter package, most of it is purpose built for the unique needs of HPR. This package is mainly concerned with automating recovery deployment and relaying telemetry from HPR vehicles.

Things are still very much in development.
